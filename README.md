# genetic-tree-builder
Implementation of the UPGMA algorithm for reconstruction of ultrametric genetic trees from sequence alignments.
Can be used to efficiently construct a phylogenetic tree representing the genetic similarity relationships between different species.
It is possible to choose between Hamming distance, JC69 and K80 as the distance measure between genetic sequences.

This programming task was given as a biweekly assignment in the class "Computational Biology" by Tanja Stadler, Carsten Magnus and Tim Vaughan at ETH Zurich. The structure of the code, including some predefined helper functions, was given, the implementation of the algortihm is my own.
